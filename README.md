# Slider

A basic slider with next and previous buttons using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

It has the following features:

• It is a basic slider with the functionality of moving slides left and right
on clicking the next and previous buttons.
• Javascript function is used in a way such that it works with any
no. of similar sliders on a single page or on entire website.
 (For eg. - If we want to use the slider twice /thrice or any number of
 times, a single javascript function works for both of them and
 does not interfere with other sliders at a particular run-time.
